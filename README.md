🏁 Final Project: Build an End-to-End ETL Pipeline
🎯 Objective:
Design and implement a simple ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline using real-world data. The pipeline should extract data from a raw source, clean and transform it, and load it into a target destination (e.g., a CSV file, SQLite database, or simulated data warehouse). Automation using Airflow is encouraged for intermediate students.

🧩 Project Overview:
Scenario (make up your own)
You work as a junior data engineer at a retail analytics company. Your task is to build a data pipeline that processes daily sales data from an e-commerce site and makes it available for business analysts to use in dashboards and reports.

🗂️ Suggested Tech Stack:
Python for data handling and scripting

Pandas for transformations

SQL / SQLite for loading structured data

Apache Spark for scalable data processing (if dataset is large)

Airflow for automation (optional but encouraged)

Jupyter Notebook for documentation & development

🧪 Dataset Sources
Choose one public dataset from any of the following sources (or bring your own if approved by the instructor):

Kaggle Datasets

Data.gov

Our World in Data

OpenML

https://data.gov.sa/

https://open.data.gov.sa/ar/home

https://dp.stats.gov.sa/dashboard


📋 Requirements:
🔹 Phase 1: Extract
Load raw data from a CSV, JSON, etc... or public API (use requests or pandas.read_*)

Validate schema and shape of raw data

Log the extraction timestamp and source

🔹 Phase 2: Transform
Clean the dataset:

Handle missing values

Convert data types

Remove duplicates

Apply business logic:

Calculate KPIs like revenue = price * quantity

Create new columns (e.g., customer segment, product category)

Normalize or aggregate data if needed (e.g., group by region or date)

Use Pandas (and optionally Spark) to perform these transformations

🔹 Phase 3: Load
Load the cleaned data into:

SQLite database (recommended for simplicity) OR

Write to a .csv or .parquet file (simulate a data lake)

Write an SQL script or use SQLAlchemy to create and populate target tables

🔹 (Optional) Phase 4: Automate
Create an Airflow DAG that automates the ETL process:

extract() task

transform() task

load() task

Use BashOperator or PythonOperator

🗃️ Deliverables:
etl_pipeline.ipynb or .py script

Cleaned dataset (CSV/DB)

SQL schema or .db file (if using SQLite)

Optional: etl_dag.py if using Airflow

Project README file or markdown explanation within notebook
